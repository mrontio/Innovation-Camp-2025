# Innovation Camp Raspberry Pi Repository
The MINDS CDT + SustAI CDT Innovation Camp 2025 hackathon uses the Raspberry Pi and HPC to create an interesting demonstrator project for use in the British Science Festival and beyond!

This repository contains:
- Everything needed to initialise a Raspbian 64-bit image with the configurations, packages, and virtual environments.
- Example files for each of the sensors.

We hope you enjoy this hackathon, and create something worth showing at the BSF!

## On a brand new Raspbian image
At the beginning, you will likely have a Raspbian image that only has an internet connection.
Let's change that.

1. Pull the repository
```bash
git clone <TODO>
```

2. Do the rest
