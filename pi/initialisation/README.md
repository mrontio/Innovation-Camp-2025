# Pi Scripts
This directory contains all the scripts needed to initialise and re-initialise a raspberry Pi image from scratch, or when something goes wrong.

## Brand new Raspbian image
At the beginning, you will likely have a Raspbian image that only has an internet connection.
We need to install the necessary packages and configurations, and we can do that with the scripts in this directory:

1. Pull the repository and enter into the installation directory
   ```bash
   cd ~/Downloads
   git clone https://github.com/mrontio/Innovation-Camp-2025.git
   cd Innovation-Camp-2025/pi/initialisation/
   ```

2. Run the initialisation script
   ```bash
   ./initialise.sh
   ```
   The script will:
   - Create the necessary changes in raspi-config [pi-conig.sh](./scripts/pi-config.sh)
   - Update & install necessary packages [apt.sh](./scripts/apt.sh)
   - Create a virtual environment [venv.sh](./scripts/venv.sh)
   - Install the packages in that virtual environment [pip.sh](./scripts/pip.sh)
   - Add the virtual environment to your environment file (.bashrc) [bashrc.sh](./scripts/bashrc.sh)

3. The system will reboot at the end of the script. This is so that the hardware configurations can be enabled.

3. And Voil√†, you have a system ready to hack on.

## Re-creating the virtual environment
Broke your pip installation? Don't worry, you can get back to a prepared virtual environment by running the following:

1. Run
```bash
./reload-venv.sh
```

2. Re-source the environment
```bash
source ~/hackathon-venv/bin/activate
```

3. And install the rest of the required files. A dump all the packages of the old environment will be put in your ~/Downloads folder.
