# Innovation Camp Raspberry Pi Repository
The MINDS CDT + SustAI CDT Innovation Camp 2025 hackathon uses the Raspberry Pi and HPC to create an interesting demonstrator project for use in the British Science Festival and beyond!

This repository contains:
- Everything needed to initialise a Raspbian 64-bit image with the configurations, packages, and virtual environments.
- Example files for each of the sensors.

We hope you enjoy this hackathon, and create something worth showing at the BSF!

## Directory Layout

- [initialisation/](./initialisation): Go here to initialise a new Raspberry Pi installation.
- [examples/](./examples): Examples provided to get you started.
  - [examples/video-introduction/](./examples/video-introduction): The files from the hardware introduction video.
  - [examples/sensor-examples/](./examples/sensor-examples): Example files for a selection of sensors that you can copy and re-use.
